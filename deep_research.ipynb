       "As of June 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent, autonomous systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen is an open-source framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications. Its architecture comprises three layers: Core, AgentChat, and Extensions. Core provides a programming framework for scalable agent networks, AgentChat facilitates the development of conversational AI assistants, and Extensions offer additional functionalities and integrations. AutoGen also includes tools like AutoGen Bench for performance assessment and AutoGen Studio for no-code agent development. ([ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/top-ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangGraph**: LangGraph utilizes graph-based architectures to manage stateful AI workflows, making it suitable for complex, multi-step tasks. It maintains state throughout workflows, allowing for pause, resume, or modification without losing progress. This feature is particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring human intervention or error recovery. ([bridgged.com](https://www.bridgged.com/post/the-top-5-ai-agent-frameworks-to-watch-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CrewAI**: CrewAI focuses on real-time collaboration among multiple agents or between humans and agents. It employs a Pythonic design, using annotations to define agents, tools, tasks, and processes, which are organized into \"crews.\" CrewAI orchestrates interactions among these components, facilitating efficient teamwork in complex multi-agent systems. ([workos.com](https://workos.com/blog/top-ai-agent-frameworks-and-platforms-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Eliza**: Eliza is an open-source, Web3-friendly AI agent operating system that integrates seamlessly with blockchain applications. It allows for the deployment of AI agents capable of interacting with smart contracts and blockchain data, expanding the scope of AI agents into decentralized environments. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoAgent**: AutoAgent is a fully automated, zero-code framework enabling users to create and deploy LLM agents using natural language alone. It comprises components like Agentic System Utilities, LLM-powered Actionable Engine, Self-Managing File System, and Self-Play Agent Customization module, facilitating efficient and dynamic creation of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements.
